# Where Dey At Do
An app that lets you know where someone is at. Some users will be able to post points on the map while others will be able to see those points.

## Why
Some public transportation use outdated and inaccurate location software. This is an attempt to provide a simple solution to keeping up where public transport currently is. 

## Future

WDAD is currently a simple web site, but it would probably be better as a mobile app. Also using a phones native geolocation is probably going to be more accurate. 

## Running the app

1. `npm i`
2. `meteor`
3. Go To localhost:3000
4. Create an account with name `bus1`

*`bus1` can CRUD points, but normal accounts can only view*
